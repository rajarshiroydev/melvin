This is Melvin, an AI Machine Learning Engineer. Inspired from Devin which is an AI Software Engineer. Below are the things that Melvin can do autonomously: 
- Analyse the MLEbench lite datasets from Kaggle.
- Decides the type of ML task it needs to perform based on the analysis.
- Generates the optimal training script for the dataset.
- Runs the training script.
- Generates a submission.csv.
